                <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Leopard</h1>
                <p>The leopard is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range.</p>
                <p>Leopards are elusive, solitary and largely nocturnal. They have a very broad diet and can eat a wide variety of prey including reptiles, birds, and mammals. They are known for their ability to adapt to various habitats and for their strength, being able to carry prey larger than themselves up into trees to avoid scavengers.</p>
                <p>The leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its skin color varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. The patterns of the rosettes are unique to each individual.</p>
                <p>Leopards are capable of running at over 58 kilometers per hour (36 mph), jumping over 6 meters (20 ft) horizontally, and leaping up to 3 meters (10 ft) vertically.</p>

                <h2>Leopards in Yala National Park</h2>
                <p>Yala National Park, located in the southeast of Sri Lanka, is renowned for its high leopard density. This park offers one of the best chances to see leopards in the wild. The leopards in Yala are known for their relatively bold nature, making them more visible to visitors. The park's varied landscape, including grasslands, forests, and lagoons, provides an ideal habitat for these big cats.</p>
                <p>Yala leopards are particularly famous due to their adaptation to daylight activity, making it easier for tourists to spot them during safari tours. These leopards are often seen resting on rocky outcrops or patrolling their territory along the park's numerous trails. The abundance of prey, such as spotted deer and wild boar, supports a healthy leopard population.</p>
                <p>Yala's leopards have been the subject of numerous wildlife documentaries and research studies, further highlighting their significance in the region's biodiversity. The park management also employs several conservation strategies to protect these majestic creatures, including anti-poaching patrols and habitat restoration projects.</p>

                <h2>Leopards in Wilpattu National Park</h2>
                <p>Wilpattu National Park, located in the northwest of Sri Lanka, is the largest national park in the country. It is known for its unique "willus" (natural lakes) which provide vital water sources for the park's wildlife. Leopards in Wilpattu are more elusive compared to those in Yala, but the park's vast and varied terrain offers excellent opportunities for sightings, particularly around the waterholes.</p>
                <p>Leopards in Wilpattu are adept at using the park's dense scrub and forest areas for cover. This makes them harder to spot, but it also indicates their successful adaptation to a variety of habitats. Visitors often catch glimpses of these leopards during early morning or late afternoon safaris when they are most active.</p>
                <p>Conservation efforts in Wilpattu focus on preserving the natural water sources and maintaining the park's rich biodiversity. These efforts ensure that the leopards and other wildlife continue to thrive in their natural habitat. Research and monitoring programs are also in place to study the behavior and population dynamics of Wilpattu's leopards.</p>

                <h2>Leopards in Kumana National Park</h2>
                <p>Kumana National Park, also known as Yala East, is located in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka. This park is famous for its avian population but also hosts a significant number of leopards. The leopards in Kumana are often seen near the park's numerous water bodies and dense forest areas. Kumana offers a quieter, more secluded experience for wildlife enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>Kumana's leopards are well-adapted to the park's wetland ecosystem, often seen hunting near the water sources where prey animals gather. The park's remoteness and lower visitor numbers provide a less disturbed environment for these leopards, contributing to their natural behavior and healthy population.</p>
                <p>The park's management places a strong emphasis on conservation and protection, ensuring that leopards and other wildlife are safeguarded from poaching and habitat destruction. Regular patrols and community engagement programs help in maintaining the delicate balance of Kumana's ecosystem.</p>

                <h2>Leopards in Horton Plains National Park</h2>
                <p>Horton Plains National Park, located in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park's montane grassland and cloud forest provide a unique habitat for leopards. Sightings here are rarer due to the dense vegetation and the park's higher altitude. However, the leopards of Horton Plains are adapted to cooler climates and the park's rugged terrain.</p>
                <p>Leopards in Horton Plains are known for their elusive nature, often remaining hidden in the thick forest cover. Visitors to the park may occasionally spot these magnificent cats during early morning hikes or while exploring the park's scenic trails. The leopards' diet in Horton Plains includes a variety of prey such as sambars and small mammals.</p>
                <p>Conservation initiatives in Horton Plains focus on preserving the unique montane ecosystem and its biodiversity. Efforts include habitat restoration, anti-poaching measures, and scientific research to monitor the leopard population and their health.</p>
